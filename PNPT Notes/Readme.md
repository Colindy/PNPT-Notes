## Read Me md

Greetings.

This is a collection of my notes for the PNPT (which I passed earlier in 2025), and my OSCP notes (which I am currently working on).  I tried to understand the material, not just rewrite notes from the different platforms.  That being said, some of the screenshots are from the material but not all.  I tried to use my own screenshots where I could but others just made sense to keep the graphic from the material.

This is in NO WAY meant to be a replacement for either of those courses.  If you're reading these you'll find that some of my sections are light on the notes.  Those are the sections and concepts I already had a pretty firm grasp on.  Others have more notes and explainations.  Those are the ones I did not know as well as I wanted to and therefore had more extensive note taking.

If you are using this to help study, then Cheers and best of luck to you on your pentesting journey!  I know mine has been a blast!

You will **NOT** find any writeups or technical details of either the PNPT, PWPA, or OSCP exams in this or any of my other repositories.  Save you the time of checking for answers or hints.  :)
