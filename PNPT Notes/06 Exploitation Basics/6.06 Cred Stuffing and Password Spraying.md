### Credential Stuffing

Credential Stuffing - Injecting breached credentials into a login form in hopes of finding a login  
&ensp;	Differs from brute-force in that it will try an account once with the associated password and then move on, creating a single login for a user instead of multiple.

Intruder in Burp Suite can be used for this  
&ensp;	First thing you want to do is make sure you set the changing fields correctly  
&ensp;	Then, set your attack type  
&ensp;&ensp;		Pitchfork  used for this type of attack (sniper is the other most common, using a single parameter)



Password Spraying - using known usernames without a known password.  
&ensp;	Take known usernames and set a single common password and try those usernames against that single password.  
&ensp;	Also done in Intruder with the Sniper attack type.  


Make sure you know the password policy as you tread on locking user accounts with these methods.
