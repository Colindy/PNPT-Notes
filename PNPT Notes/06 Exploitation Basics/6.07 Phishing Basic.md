### Phishing Basics

Here we assume that we have initial access to an email server, have tried the password and have not gotten any hits on it.  We also know that it's used by multiple people.  We can use this to create a phishing email and send it out.

First we search the email and we find that there is a sent email.  We can use that sent email and an LLM to craft our phishing email.  Take the email and ask the LLM to craft a new email in that same style but for a different purpose and include a place to put a url link into the email.

Next, we clone a website and we'll serve that up via a web server.

```
mkdir clonedsite
cd clonedsite
wget -E -k -K -p -e robots=off -H -D <url.here> -nd "https://specific.url/to/copy"
```

We'll use `-E` to change the file extension to match the MIME type of the downloaded file. We'll convert all the links in the document to point to local alternatives with `-k` and use `-K` to save the original file with a `.orig` extension, for original (this will also cause us to have to adjust the url slightly as there will be a .orig and a .html file now). Then, we'll use `-p` to download all the files necessary for viewing the specific page. The `-e robots=off` will ignore robots.txt directives which might slow the download. We'll download all files from external hosts with `-H`, limited to files on the `url.here` domain with `-D zoom.us`. Finally, we will use `-nd` save all files in a flat directory structure in our current working directory.

Once that is done we start an http server with `python3 http.server 80` and then navigate to the url specified, modified slightly, in the previous command to verify the page loads.  The modification, for example, might be the following...

Original  
`https://zoom.us/signin#/login`  
Used to check  
`http://zoom.us/signin.html#/login`

It appears you need to add the html part before the `#` to tell the browser the local copy is an html page.

If you get a cookie or any sort of legitimate popup, we need to click on it and go through it to make sure there are no errors.

At that point, we can use LLM to create some php code to gather the creds and make any adjustments needed to the functionality of the signin, then test the pages functionality.  Finally we put in the html link to the malicious page into the email and send it out.

Then we monitor the file that we set to record the inputs and keep our fingers crossed.
