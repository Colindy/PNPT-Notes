### AntiVirus Evasion

Anti-virus works in a number of different ways.  Starting out as purely signature based, it made decisions based on different signatures that it knew.  Comparing traffic to those signatures was how it determined if what it was comparing was malicious.

Depending on the AV engine, these signatures can vary greatly, even for the same piece of malware.  One signature may deal with the malware stored on a hard drive and another may deal with the malware while it's in transmission on the network.

VirusTotal can be a good resource to check binaries against.  But, do note that any file submitted to VirusTotal is considered Public upon submission.

Beyond that though, VirusTotal can give you a wealth of information about a file that was uploaded in the behavior tab.  It may take a sec to run but it's worth the wait.

#### On-Disk Evasion

`packers` were used in the early times as a way to compress executables.  Not just like a ZIP file, these would actually generate an executable that was smaller but did the same thing as the original source code.  This would also change the hash making it an effective way to bypass signature based AV models of the time.

`obfuscators` change and mutate code.  They can even add irrelevant bits of code called `dead code`.  They can split and reorder functions, or replace bits of code with different code but will get the same output.  Used a lot by developers to protect IP, it's decent against signature based AVs.  Some modern ones even have `runtime in-memory` capabilities, making it even harder for AV to detect.

`crypter` software can encrypt exectuable code and add a decryption stub to restore code upon execution.  Since the decryption happens in memory, this avoids AV detection from scanners of storage.
