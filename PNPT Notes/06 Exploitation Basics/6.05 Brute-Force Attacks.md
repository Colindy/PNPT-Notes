### Brute-Force Attacks

Brute-Force is trying a bunch of different passwords until either something works or you exhaust the list.

Tools include:

Hydra - brute-force tool

`hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://10.0.2.8:22 -t 4 -V`  

At this point you can pick a word list, here its unix_passwords.txt.  the -l (lowercase) is for a single user.  L for a userlist followed by the userlist location.  -P (uppercase) for the password list to try followed by the txt doc location to use.  lowercase if you want to try a single password followed by what you want to use.  -t is the threads which is set to 4 and the -V is verbosity in the logs.

You can also use different items such as http requests (because free burp is sloooow).

`hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.x.x http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed. Invalid"`

We use the info gathered from burp and the site to craft our hydra command.

`hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt http-get://192.168.x.x/`

You can also do http-get requests.  You're looking for the same info.  With the `http-get` though, there is less to input.

metasploit can do the same thing.  
&ensp;	search for exploit, such as ssh_login or something of the sort  
&ensp;	user Metasploit the same way you would anytime  
&ensp;	set your options  
&ensp;	verify your options  
&ensp;	run your exploit  

These can run pretty slow.
