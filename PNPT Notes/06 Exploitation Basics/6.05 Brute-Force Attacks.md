### Brute-Force Attacks

Brute-Force is trying a bunch of different passwords over and over again.

Tools include:

Hydra - brute-force tool  
&ensp;	`hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://10.0.2.8:22 -t 4 -V`  
&ensp;&ensp;		At this point you can pick a word list, here its unix_passwords.txt.  
&ensp;&ensp;		the -l (lowercase) is for a single user.  L for a userlist followed by the userlist location  
&ensp;&ensp;		-P (uppercase) for the password list to try followed by the txt doc location to use.  lowercase if you want to try a single password followed by what you want to use  
&ensp;&ensp;		-t 4 -V    -t is the threads which is set to 4 and the -V is verbosity in the logs.  

metasploit can do the same thing.  
&ensp;	search for exploit, such as ssh_login or something of the sort  
&ensp;	user Metasploit the same way you would anytime  
&ensp;	set your options  
&ensp;	verify your options  
&ensp;	run your exploit  

These can run pretty slow.
