### Manual Exploitation

Can download exploits manually via a couple sources.  Github was one shown in the video.

In order to use a c file, you have to have a complier.

`gcc -o OpenFuck OpenFuck.c -lcrypto`  - This will compile the c file `OpenFuck.c` into the -o (output) of OpenFuck.  The `-lcrypto` is for  

Don't be afraid to use manual tactics if that suits.  Search github and other resources.  Be sure to trust said resources.

Other resources can include many things.  Websites and such are as follows:

Exploit DB - `www.exploitdb.com`  
Packet Storm - `https://packetstorm.news/`  
GitHub - `www.github.com`  

There are also some offline references for when you aren't able to get to the internet.

Metasploit  
Core Impact - no free version  
Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)  

Searchsploit - `/usr/share/exploitdb` - Split into two major sections, `/exploits` and `/shellcodes`.  We can use this from the command line with the command `searchsploit`.

`searchsploit [options] term1 [term2]`

You can use different options, such as `-m` which will copy the exploit to your current folder so you can modify it and use it.

Search for everything.  If you find a random exe file somewhere, see if that runs any services with exploits.  If you don't see anything right away, try nmapping on all ports with `-p-` and seeing what comes back.  You may find something outside of the normal ports that may be vulnerable.

#### NMAP NSE

Nmap itself holds many scripts for use.  With the `--script <scriptName>`

You can also search for more information on a particular script with `nmap script-help=<scriptName>`
