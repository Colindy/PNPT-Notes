Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Broken Objects Level Authorization (BOLA) (This is in the API world) are basically the same thing.

Basically you can take a reference number and access information simply by changing it in the URL.

For example, if you sign into a website and get something that looks like the following:
	`http://localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=1009` 
You might be able to change the `1009` portion of the URL to access other accounts, like the admin account.

You can also use `ffuf` in order to quickly run through a number of options.  Use python in order to make a list of numbers `python3 -c 'for i in range(1,2001): print(i) > num.txt` and spit it out to the file `num.txt`.

Then use that with the URL you had a FUZZ the number to see which ones come back with hits.  You can filter by response size (`-fs`) to keep just the ones you want.
