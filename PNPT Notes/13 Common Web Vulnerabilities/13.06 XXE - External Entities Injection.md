### XXE - External Entities Injection

XXE takes advantage of XML vulnerabilities.  These are usually pretty well patched now-a-days but it's worth looking at.

payloadsallthethings in github has a good list but below is an example:

xxe-safe.xml  
	```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<creds>
	    <user>testuser</user>
	    <password>testpass</password>
	</creds>```

Here the application is expecting your xml info in this format.  This will add a user (testuser) and a password for that user (testpass).

To take advantage of this, you can utilize XML in the following way:

xxe-exploit.xml  
	```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE creds [
	<!ELEMENT creds ANY >
	<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
	<creds><user>&xxe;</user><password>pass</password></creds>```

Here we create an !ENTITY called xxe and reference the /etc/passwd file with it.  We then call that in the user portion of the XML and it puts the passwd file in where the username should be.  If this works correctly, it should make the contents of the passwd file a user.  If the app returns what was just entered, you have your passwd file :)

You can also try this on apps that expect json as they may also accept xml and may be vulnerable.
