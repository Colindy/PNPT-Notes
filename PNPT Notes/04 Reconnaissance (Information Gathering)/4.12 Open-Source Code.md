### Open-Source Code

Sites like the following can have open-source code saved that may yield some information.

github.com  
gist.github.com  
about.gitlab.com  
sourceforge.net  

Tools like `gitrob` (https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) and `gitleaks` (https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) can help parse through some larger repos.  `gitrob` appears to not have been updated for about 7 years now.

If using tools to search github, you'll need to create yourself a Personal Access token.  A good guide can be found here on how to create these (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
