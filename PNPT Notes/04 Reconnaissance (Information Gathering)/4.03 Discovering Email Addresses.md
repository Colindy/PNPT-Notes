### Finding Emails

hunter.io - This is an online tool.  You get a number of free searches per month.  This tool can give you email formatting (like first_initial_last_name@company.com and things like that).  This can also give you some info on emails for specific departments.

phonebook.cz - This is another online tool.  You can also gather domain and URL information.  With the pro version you can even check into the emails themselves and get more info.

voilanorbert.com - This is a pay resource that works much like hunter.io.

clearbit connect - This has to be used in Chrome.  Very useful tool.  Only 100 free per month though so don't burn through it.

tools.verifyemailaddress.io - Use this for email address verification as to whether it exists or not.

email-checker.net/validate - This will also check and verify that emails are legitimate or not.

Don't forget the "lost password" feature.  Some websites will show you either part or all of a recovery email address if it's different than the account email.
