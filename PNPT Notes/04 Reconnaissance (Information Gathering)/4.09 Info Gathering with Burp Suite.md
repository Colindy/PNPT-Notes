### Burpe Suite

Burp Suite is a "web proxy".  It grabs website requests and allows you to see the packets going to and from the web server.

Setup for use by setting the firefox proxy to 127.0.0.1 with port 8080.  Also, first time users, make sure you import the CA Certificate from `https://burp` and then importing it into your certificates via the privacy and security tab.

Checking the response to packets can give a large amount of information about different things running.  Some could even be reportable, as info but still noteable.
