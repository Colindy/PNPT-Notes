### OSINT Tools

Exif Tool  
&ensp;	`exiftool <img>` to pull the exif data  
&ensp;	`exiftool <img> > file.txt` will save that same data to a txt file  

Hunting Emails and Breached Data  
&ensp;	`https://github.com/hmaverickadams/DeHashed-API-Tool` - This was written by the course instructor and does require a PAID sub to dehashed and their API tool in order to work.  These is a readme file that gives some instruction as well.  

Username and Account OSINT  
&ensp;	`sudo apt install sherlock`  
&ensp;	`sherlock <accountname>`  
&ensp;&ensp;		There is also a webapp called whatsmyname.app that will also return some results.  

Phone Number OSINT  
&ensp;	`phoneinfoga scan -n 1234567890`  - This will need to be downloaded and installed from github (`sundowndev.github.io`), not with sudo apt.  
&ensp;	`phoneinfoga serve -p 8080` - Run this and then go to `http://localhost:8080` and this will give you a local webpage to run your searches from.  

Social Media OSINT  
&ensp;	For instagram, can run at google, `instagram OSINT site:github.com` in order to pull some tools from github.  You can use this same methodology to search for other social media OSINT tools.  
&ensp;&ensp;		Many of these tools can be put into the /opt folder.  

### OSINT Frameworks

`recon-ng` - works a lot like metasploit  
&ensp;	Has a place called the `marketplace`.  
&ensp;&ensp;		`marketplace search` - Will list out the tools available.  
&ensp;&ensp;		`marketplace install <tool>` - will install the tool you specify  
&ensp;&ensp;		`modules load <tool>` - will load the tool you wish to use  
&ensp;&ensp;		`show hosts` - will show you the host table that has been built thus far.  This will hold between tools  

Maltego - Open from icon.  Run Maltego Free.  This will require an account.  
&ensp;	This is a program that uses 'modules'.  Some tools require API keys for most if not all of these modules.  
	
Hunchly - https://hunch.ly  
&ensp;	Web capture tool designed for investigations.  This is also a paid tool.  It is a google chrome extension, will only run in Chrome.  

### OSINT Automation

Many of these things can be automated with some scripting language.  They are all pretty much command line based.  Just make sure you follow good practices.  
&ensp;	Create directories and sub-directories in your scripts to keep your files organized.  
&ensp;	Test your code to make sure it processes like you want  
&ensp;	Refine and filter your scripts based on what you want to actually test  
&ensp;&ensp;		Make sure you are limiting your scans to in-scope items so you don't get unwanted extra info
