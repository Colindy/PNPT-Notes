### Social Media OSINT

Geocodes  
&ensp;	Obtained by searching in google for any location.  When the map comes up, this will be in the url of the results.  

Twitter  
&ensp;	twitter.com/search-advanced is a great tool to search twitter.  Everything in twitter (unless the profile is private) will be public.  
&ensp;&ensp;		Can also use `from:` `to:` and `@` to specify searches.  
&ensp;&ensp;		You can also craft searches, almost like google dorks.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;			`from:<person> since:<yyyy-mm-dd> until:<yyyy-mm-dd>` Will give you a result of tweets from a person between the dates in the range.  You can work with different operators too (from, to, @, etc).  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;			`from:<person> nfl` will show you any tweets from `<person>` talking about 'nfl'.  
&ensp;&ensp;		You can also search geocodes (doesn't always work as geotags need to be turned on on the device that was used to make the post or take the picture)  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;			`geocode:<geocode.10km>`  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;				This will search within 10km of the geocode provided

Facebook  
&ensp;	Simple search can help but facebook has become more aware of privacy.  
&ensp;	Some tools to use:  
&ensp;&ensp;		OSINT Tool Collection: https://github.com/rmdir-rp/OSINT-twitter-tools  
&ensp;&ensp;		IntelligenceX Facebook Search - https://intelx.io/tools?tab=facebook  
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;		Wildcard searches do not really work  
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;			You can go to a user's page on facebook, view the page source, ctrl+f and enter userID and that will show you the user's ID.  

Instagram  
&ensp;	Not the best searching.  Limited to pictures but a lot of info can be gleaned from pictures.  
&ensp;	On a profile, you can view page source and find profilePage_ and this will take you to the profile ID.  Even if you change your name, the ID will not change.  
&ensp;	`imginn.com/profile` where profile is the profile name.  But this will pull down the image.  

SnapChat  
&ensp;	Not a whole lot of things for snapchat.  It doesn't really keep pictures after they are opened.  
&ensp;	`https://map.snapchat.com` can possibly give some information if you know a location.  

Reddit  
&ensp;	/u/(name) to search users on reddit.  
&ensp;	you can also search google with operators with `site:reddit.com` and search there.  

LinkedIn  
&ensp;	Business professionals facebook.  A lot of people share a lot of stuff on here.  

TikTok  
&ensp;	/@username will search the user from the website.  
&ensp;	TikTok has locked down quite a bit since it's beginning days.  
&ensp;	Right click on a picture, open in a new tab, and now you have the full sized image.
