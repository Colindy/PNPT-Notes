### Cred Gathering

Installing - This can be done in the `/opt/` folder in order to make the tool work (you may have to `mkdir` this folder)

&ensp;	`sudo git clone https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse`
&ensp;	`cd /breach-parse/`
&ensp;	`sudo ./install.sh`

Once installed, you will want to put the BreachCompilation folder in the /opt/ folder.

Then run it via the following command:  
&ensp;	`sudo ./breach-parse.sh @tesla.com tesla.txt`  
&ensp;&ensp;		The `@tesla.com` portion gives the search parameters and the `tesla.txt` portion gives the location of the information to be put into a txt file.
