Credential Stuffing - Injecting breached credentials into a login form in hopes of finding a login
	Differs from brute-force in that it will try an account once with the associated password and then move on, creating a single login for a user instead of multiple.

Intruder in Burp Suite can be used for this
	First thing you want to do is make sure you set the changing fields correctly
	Then, set your attack type
		Pitchfork  used for this type of attack (sniper is the other most common, using a single parameter)



Password Spraying - using known usernames without a known password.
	Take known usernames and set a single common password and try those usernames against that single password.
	Also done in Intruder with the Sniper attack type.


Make sure you know the password policy as you tread on locking user accounts with these methods.
