Brute-Force is trying a bunch of different passwords over and over again.

Tools include:

Hydra - brute-force tool
	`hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://10.0.2.8:22 -t 4 -V` 
		At this point you can pick a word list, here its unix_passwords.txt.
		the -l (lowercase) is for a single user.  L for a userlist followed by the userlist location
		-P (uppercase) for the password list to try followed by the txt doc location to use.  lowercase if you want to try a single password followed by what you want to use
		-t 4 -V    -t is the threads which is set to 4 and the -V is verbosity in the logs.

metasploit can do the same thing.
	search for exploit, such as ssh_login or something of the sort
	user Metasploit the same way you would anytime
	set your options
	verify your options
	run your exploit

These can run pretty slow.
