`echo "hello"`    will print out `hello` in the terminal
`echo "hello" > hey.txt`   will save `hello` to a txt file
`cat hey.txt`    will print out the context of `hey.txt` in the terminal (in this case, `hello`)
`touch newfile.txt`    will create a file `newfile.txt` with nothing in it.


Appending files
	`echo "hello again" > hey.txt`    this will overwrite the original text since the file already exists from before.
	`echo "hello again" >> hey.txt`   The extra `>` makes it append to the end of the original in a new line

Editing Text
	`nano newfile.txt`   The command `nano` is a text editor that you can use since vi and vim are trash ;) lol.
		Nano Commands  - are also along the bottom of the page in the Nano window
			`ctrl X` and then `y` to save.  Then confirm the name of the file once you have finished editing

`mousepad newfile.txt`  The `mousepad` command is a gui style text editor similiar to notepad.

`nano` and `mousepad` will also create a file if you use a filename that is not already made in the directory you are in.
