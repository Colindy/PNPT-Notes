1: declare your language "SHIBANG!!"
3: your 'if' statement.  `$1` means your first argument when you run the script.  If you don't put anything, this will kick out a message.
4: don't forget your 'then' part of the 'if-then' loop
5-6: echo back the message to remind you to add an argument.
8: is your 'else' statement part of the loop
9: the start of your 'for' loop.  `ip` can be named anything.  `seq 1 254` says every number in a sequence from 1 to 254.  Ended with `; do` to tell the script to do the next line in a command format.
10: The command you want to be run.  `$1` adds the first argument supplied when running the script.  `$ip` adds in the variable from line 9 and runs through that sequence.  Also, it ends the line with `&`.  This allows multiple instances to run at the same time, meaning it will not wait for the first one to complete before starting the second one, greatly speeding up the process.
11: `done` ends the loop
12: `fi` ends the 'if-then' statement
