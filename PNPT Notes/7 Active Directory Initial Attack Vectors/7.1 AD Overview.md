Internal Pen Testing (done from the inside, once its compromised)

Very common.  Will be rare if you do not run into AD on any sort of assessment.

Stores information on Objects (computers, users, groups, policies, etc)

Components of AD include
	Pysical
		Data Store
			Contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services, and applications
			Consists of the NTDS.dit file
			Stored in %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all DCs by default
			Accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols
		Domain Controllers
			Is a server within the network that controls most of the AD functions
			Has been specifically promoted to Domain Controller
			Host a copy of the AD DS directory store
			Provides authentication and authorization services
			Replicate updates to other DCs in the domain and forest
			Allow admin access to manage users accounts and network resources
		Global Catalog server
		Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
	Logical
		AD DS Schema
			Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
			Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration
				Object types
					Class Object - What objects can be created (user, computer)
					Attribute Object - Info that can be attached to an Object (display name)
		Domain
			Used to group and manage objects in an organization
				Administrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects
				Replication boundary for replicating data between DCs
				Authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit scope of access to resources
		Trees
			A domain Tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS (contoso.com (parent), emea.contoso.com (child), na.contoso.com (child))
				All domains in a Tree:
					Share contiguous namespace with parent domain
					Can have child domains
					By default creates a two-way transitive trust with other domains
		Forests
			A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees
				Share a common schema
				Share a common configuration partition
				Share a common global catalog to enable searching
				Enable trusts between all domains in the forest
				Share the Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups
		Organization Units (OUs)
			AD Containers that contain users, groups, computers, and other OUs
				Represent your organization hierarchically and logically
				Manage a collection of objects in a consistent way
				Delegate permissions to administer groups of objects
				Apply policies
		Trusts
			Provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain
				Directional - flows from trusting domain to the trusted domain
				Transitive - extended beyond a two-domain trust to include other trusted domains

		Objects
			Everything within AD
				Users, groups, computers, printers, shared folders, contacts, InetOrgPerson
