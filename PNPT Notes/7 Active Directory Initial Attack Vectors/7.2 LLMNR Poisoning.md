Link Local Multicast Name Resolution
Identifies host when DNS fails to do so
Previously NBT-NS

Responder
	`sudo responder -I eth0 -dP`
	This will start responder on Interface eth0 with the tags of:
		-d  enables answers for dhcp broadcasts
		-w  Start the WPAD rogue proxy server (d and w can not run together)
		-P  Force NTLM/Basic authentication for proxy (Works very well)
		-v  Not listed here but will skip over already found hashes that would be skipped if already found
	Once you start to get hashes, you can use hashcat to crack your harvested hashes
