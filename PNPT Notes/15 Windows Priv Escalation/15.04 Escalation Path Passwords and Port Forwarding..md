### Password and Port Forwarding escalation path

See my PenTest writeups, Chatterbox machine for these.

Used Sushant747 gitbooks (listed earlier in the notes) to get to the password, just going through.

Used a tool called plink.exe (also mentioned in Sushant747) in order to access internal ports.

Also used Certutil in order to move files from one device to another
