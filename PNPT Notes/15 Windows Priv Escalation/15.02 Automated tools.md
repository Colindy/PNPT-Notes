### Automated Tools

When uploading these tools, you can usually put them in C:\Windows\Temp  
&ensp;If you're in a meterpreter session, using the following commands should accomplish this.  
&ensp;&ensp;`meterpreter> cd c:\\windows\\temp`    - use the extra \ in order to escape the character so that it's not used as code  
&ensp;&ensp;`mterpreter> upload <local file path of your tool>`  
&ensp;If you need to get into powershell to try another tool, use the following  
&ensp;&ensp;`meterpreter> shell`  
&ensp;&ensp;`meterpreter> powershell -ep bypass`  - `-ep` means execution policy and you are bypassing that.  
&ensp;If that doesn't work from shell, you can try directly from meterpreter prompt  
&ensp;&ensp;`meterpreter> load powershell`  
&ensp;You can also run the post exploit module from metasploit.  This works as a suggester to give you a few different avenues.   
&ensp;&ensp;`meterpreter> run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`  - you can tab this out as well  
&ensp;&ensp;Once that finishes, you can take that and any info you get from `systeminfo` and copy them into a notepad file.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;`meterpreter> shell`  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;`c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>systeminfo`  - save this, it will be needed later  
&ensp;Also run windows exploit suggester by extracting it after download and then doing the following  
&ensp;&ensp;`root@kali:~/Downloads# cd ~` - either to root or wherever you extracted the package  
&ensp;&ensp;`root@kali:~# ./windows-exploit-suggeter.py --update`  - You'll want to note the database from this command in the `writing to file <filename>` where the filename will be the database.  
&ensp;&ensp;`pip install xlrd --upgrade`  - this will update or install the python-xlrd dependancy  
&ensp;&ensp;`root@kali:~# ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <the database from the update command> --systeminfo <the file with the sysinfo in it>`  


Always Always ALWAYS try more tools.  If one doesn't work, try the next one, and if that doesn't work, try still the next one.



WinPEAS - https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS
&ensp;Does require .NET 4.0 or higher.  There is a .bat file to check if this script will work.

Windows PrivEsc Checklist - https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation
&ensp;This is a handy tool, giving you a checklist of sorts to see what you could run.

Sherlock - https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock
&ensp;Powershell script that looks for common vulnerabilities.

Watson - https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson
&ensp;Another scan like Sherlock.  This does need to be compiled though.  This requires you know the version of .NET that is installed.

PowerUp - https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Privesc
&ensp;Very nice tool.

JAWS - https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS

Seatbelt - https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt
&ensp;This also needs to be compiled, like Watson.
