### Wrapping Up

Client Debriefs  
&ensp;Keep these meetings at a high level  
&ensp;More along the lines of the Executive summary  
&ensp;Keep everyone in the meeting in the know  
&ensp;"I don't know" is an ok answer but research and find the answer  
&ensp;Some people will be very upset at these  
&ensp;&ensp;Make known that we're there to educate, not get anyone in trouble  
&ensp;Some people may only have us there to check a box  
&ensp;&ensp;Not our job to fix those issues, that is up to the client  

Attestation Letters  
&ensp;Attestation - evidence or proof of something  
&ensp;You may be asked to provide an attestation letter  
&ensp;&ensp;Could be a close copy-paste from executive summary  
&ensp;&ensp;If something was fixed, note that  

Client Retests  
&ensp;These are usually limited to what was found in the report.  
&ensp;Note things that were patched and update the report  
&ensp;&ensp;"This was found and it was remediated"  
&ensp;&ensp;Not taking it off the report, just note that it's fixed.  
&ensp;This is generally part of it so keep in mind that you will likely go back and do a retest after so many days.
