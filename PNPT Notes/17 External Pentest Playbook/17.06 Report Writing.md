### Report Writting

Sample report used as template from TCM-Sec.  Fill in info as you go and get ready to turn in.

Template I have gives assessment components as internal.  If it needs to be changed out to external, switch to the following.

'An external penetration test emulates the role of an attacker attempting to gain access to an internal network without internal resources or inside knowledge.  A TCMS engineer attempts to gather sensitive information through open-source intelligence (OSINT), including employee information, historical breached passwords, and more that can be leveraged against external systems to gain internal network access.  The engineer also performs scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities in hopes of exploitation.'

&ensp;Here is where you get more detailed on how and why and what to do  
&ensp;&ensp;Don't have to get fully step by step but is more detailed  

Passwords should be blurred out  
Highlight things in screenshots to bring attention
