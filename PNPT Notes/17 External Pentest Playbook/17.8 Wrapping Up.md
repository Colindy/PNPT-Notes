Client Debriefs
	Keep these meetings at a high level
	More along the lines of the Executive summary
	Keep everyone in the meeting in the know
	"I don't know" is an ok answer but research and find the answer
	Some people will be very upset at these
		Make known that we're there to educate, not get anyone in trouble
	Some people may only have us there to check a box
		Not our job to fix those issues, that is up to the client

Attestation Letters
	Attestation - evidence or proof of something
	You may be asked to provide an attestation letter
		Could be a close copy-paste from executive summary
		If something was fixed, note that

Client Retests
	These are usually limited to what was found in the report.
	Note things that were patched and update the report
		"This was found and it was remediated"
		Not taking it off the report, just note that it's fixed.
	This is generally part of it so keep in mind that you will likely go back and do a retest after so many days.
