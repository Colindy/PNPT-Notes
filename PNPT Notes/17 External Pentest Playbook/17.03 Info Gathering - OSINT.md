### Info Gathering - OSINT

Hunting Breached Creds  
&ensp;breach-parse - from github (hmaverickadams)  
&ensp;&ensp;Putting items in excel, if the columns don't seperate out, use `Data > Text to Colunms` and that should get you going on getting those seperated.  
&ensp;Dehashed - subscription based  

Identifying Employees & Emails  
&ensp;Many of the tools used in OSINT Fundamentals are the same here  
&ensp;Phonebook.cz - Will give emails for a company  
&ensp;LinkedIn - Can give you some good info in Employees  
&ensp;&ensp;There are ways to scrape LinkedIn, check github  

Enumerating Valid Accounts Before the attack  
&ensp;Try with the login page to see what the output is.  
&ensp;&ensp;Can try the forgot password to do some account enumeration depending on the output  

Other Useful Info  
&ensp;Even if you aren't able to break into anything, still point out some deficiencies (i.e. weak password policy, etc)  
&ensp;Job postings can give you a hint of what technologies that are in play.
