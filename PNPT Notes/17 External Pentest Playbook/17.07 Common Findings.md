#### Common Findings

This list is not all-inclusive.  These are more of the common ones

Insufficient Authentication Controls  
&ensp;MFA or lackthereof  
&ensp;Usually leans to critical but could also be high depending on the circumstance  

Weak Password Policy  
&ensp;Low number of character requirements  
&ensp;Have some passwords like "Winter 2024" or "Summer2023!"  
&ensp;&ensp;Can have organizations implement deny lists for weak or common passwords  

Insufficient Patching  
&ensp;Note the patching and incorrect version  
&ensp;&ensp;Recommend current versions  

Default Credentials  
&ensp;Note location where default creds worked.  
&ensp;&ensp;Recommend to have those changed  

Insufficient Encryption  
&ensp;http vs https  
&ensp;SSL 2 and 3 vs TLS 1  
&ensp;&ensp;Recommend using more secure encryption methods.  

Information disclosure  
&ensp;Error messages that give away version numbers  
&ensp;Different username enumeration things  
&ensp;&ensp;Lockdown information being presented by invalid logins or webpage errors, etc.  

Username Enumeration  
&ensp;Another form of info disclosure but more specific  
&ensp;&ensp;Synchronize error messages to valid or invalid email/usernames  

Default Web Page  
&ensp;When you get a webserver default page, "It Works!" page or "IIS" page  
&ensp;&ensp;All webservers should have functions to either disable or remove those pages  

Open Mail Relays - Less common but still out there  
&ensp;https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-test-for-open-mail-relays/  
&ensp;Misconfiguration in a mail server  
&ensp;Can make it look like an external email is coming from an internal server  

IKE Aggressive Mode - `ike-scan`  
&ensp;It's possible to get a PSK and then crack it  
&ensp;This is older  
&ensp;&ensp;Disable Aggressive mode  

Unexpected Perimeter Services  
&ensp;Things open to the outside that should not be (smb, rdp, telnet, etc)  
&ensp;&ensp;Verify that these services are not open to the outside internet  
&ensp;&ensp;Use whitelisting if these services are needed to be outside facing  

Insufficient Traffic Blocking - shotsherpa to test  
&ensp;Not always applicable, depends on the client  
&ensp;No Geo Filtering  
&ensp;&ensp;Turn on Geo Filtering and not allow traffic from outside US  

Undetected Malicious Activity  
&ensp;SOC or other teams did not catch portions of the pentest  
&ensp;&ensp;Note which parts were not detected and bring to client's attention  
&ensp;&ensp;Be sure to bring up parts that did get detected, give kudos!  

Historical Account Compromise  
&ensp;Info from Hashed and other breaches published  
&ensp;Passwords are ALWAYS obfuscated  
&ensp;&ensp;Train users to avoid password reuse  
&ensp;&ensp;Do not use work email for other services (netflix, yahoo, google, etc)
