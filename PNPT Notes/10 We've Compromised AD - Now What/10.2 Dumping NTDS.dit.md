NTDS.dit is a database used to store AD data including:
	User Info
	Group Info
	Security Descriptors
	Password Hashes (sqee!!!)

`secretsdump.py PNPT.local/pparker:'Password2'@10.0.0.200 -just-dc-ntlm`
	This needs to be a domain admin account

PRO TIP:
	You can copy the dump output into an excel file.
	In excel, go to Data tab and select Text to Columns
		Set your Delimiter as :
		Next and Finish and you should now have all your LM hashes (remember, the second portion of the hash) and paste them into a text file and use hashcat :)
		At this point you can remove unneeded info, you really just need the account and the hash
	Now you can drop these into a mousepad ntds.txt
	Once you run those through hashcat using the `--show` at the end of the command
		`hashcat -m 1000 ntds.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show`
	Copy and paste that into excel as well in a new tab (set delimiter as needed)
	On the original tab, use the function `vlookup` to check the hashes next to the usernames with the hashes and their respective passwords
		`=vlookup(B1,Sheet2!A:B,2,False)`
	This will use vlookup to reference the hash in B1 and check it against the reference in the other sheet and it's info (Sheet2!A:B) and use column "2" as the carried over value.  We then set "False" to the range forcing it to be an exact match in order to kick anything out.
		Also, make sure your password containing column on the second tab (the reference tab) is formatted to be text and not general as excel will modify what is in the field if it's general (dates change and 0's may get dropped off if they are in the front, etc).
	Then take the end column on the first tab, Copy it, right click on the column letter (C) and Paste as Value to remove the formula and leave just the text password.
			You can usually ignore PC Passwords (ending with $)
