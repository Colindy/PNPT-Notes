### Post Compromise Attack Strategy

Provide as much value to the client as possible  
&ensp;Put blinders on and do the attack again, from the top  
&ensp;&ensp;Find other pathways to compromise the domain  
&ensp;Dump NTDS.dit and crack passwords  
&ensp;Enumerate shares for sensitive info (PII, SSN, etc)  

Persistence  
&ensp;What happens if DA access is lost?  
&ensp;Create a DA account (DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE IT AFTERWARDS!!)  
&ensp;&ensp;This SHOULD be picked up by sec teams (soc, etc)  
&ensp;Creating a Golden Ticket can be useful as well  

You are now pwner!!  Rejoice!  And then get back to work >:D
