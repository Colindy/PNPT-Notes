### Cleaning Up

Make the system/network as it was when you entered it.  
&ensp;Remove executables, scripts, added files  
&ensp;Remove malware, rootkits, added user accounts  
&ensp;Set setting back to original configurations  

You should be taking notes on everything changed so you can go back and remove it later, once the pentest is done.  

(From a Redteamer)  
&ensp;You want to remove log files created by your actions (not overly important as a pentester)
