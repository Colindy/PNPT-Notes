Make the system/network as it was when you entered it.
	Remove executables, scripts, added files
	Remove malware, rootkits, added user accounts
	Set setting back to original configurations

You should be taking notes on everything changed so you can go back and remove it later, once the pentest is done.

(From a Redteamer)
	You want to remove log files created by your actions (not overly important as a pentester)
