There are different types of loops

`for` loops run through a list, start to finish

```
fruits = ["apple", "strawberry", "raspberry", "pineapple"]

for x in fruits:
	print(x)
	#This will print out each item of a list
```


`while` loops run while a condition is true

```
i = 1

while i < 10:
	print(i) #This will print the value of i
	i += 1 #This will incriment the value of i so you don't have an infinite loop (those are bad, mkay)
```
