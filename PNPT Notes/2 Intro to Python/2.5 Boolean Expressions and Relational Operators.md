Boolean is True or False
Relational Operators compare two things and return True or False

```
# BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS  (True or False)

bool1 = True
bool2 = 3*3 == 9  # = sets a variable....== checks if one is equal to the other
bool3 = False
bool4 = 3*3 != 9  # ! = (without the space) means 'not equal to'

print(bool1, bool2, bool3, bool4)
print(type(bool1))

bool5 = "True"
print(type(bool5))  # This will return with str since the value is in " "'s

nl()

# RELATIONAL AND BOOLEAN OPERATORS
greater_than = 7 > 5
less_than = 5 < 7
greater_than_equal_to = 7 >= 7  # use > and = together
less_than_equal_to = 7 <= 7  # use < and = together

test_and = (7 > 5) and (5 < 7) #True
test_and2 = (7 > 5) and (5 > 7) #False
test_or = (7 > 5) or (5 < 7) #True
test_or2 = (7 > 5) or (5 > 7) #True

test_not = not True # False
test_not2 = not False # True
```
