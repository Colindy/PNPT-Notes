### HTTProbe and finding Alive Domains

Installing httprobe (can be found in httprobe github as well)  
`go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe`   

Httprobe scans sites to see if they are active.  

In this instance we use it in the following manner  
&ensp;`cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443'`  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;`-s` skips the default probes (`http:80` and `https:443`)  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;`-p` adds additional probe (`protocol:port`)
