First, install `assetfinder` with the following:
	`go install github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder@latest`

`assetfinder <domain>`
	This will return a list of domains that also could be related to `<domain>`

`assetfinder --subs-only <domain>`
	This will pull down domains only that are sub to `<domain>`
