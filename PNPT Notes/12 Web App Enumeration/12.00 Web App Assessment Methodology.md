### Web Application Assessment Methodology

#### NMAP

Nmap can allow you to fingerprint a webserver.

`sudo nmap -p 80 -sV 192.168.50.51`

-sV will give you the version of the service that is being scanned.

`sudo nmap -p 80 --script=http-enum 192.168.50.51`

Using NSE to gather info about the http server

#### Wappalyzer

This is a passive tool in that you interact with the website as any normal user would.

This is also a browser tool.

#### Gobuster

Used in directory brute force but is VERY noisy.  Don't use if stealth is a consideration.

`gobuster dir -u 192.168.50.51 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 5`

This command focuses on the `dir`ectory bruteforcing.  `-u` is the target/URL.  `-w` is the wordlist to brute force through.  `-t 5` allows us to rate limit ourselves by settings the max number of threads.

#### BurpSuite

Works as a web proxy and forwards traffic to an internal proxy in order to be able to inspect and manipulate html requests leaving the browser.

Some tools may require you to update the `/etc/hosts` file so that the tools can follow the links.
