Installing httprobe (can be found in httprobe github as well)
`go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe` 

Httprobe scans sites to see if they are active.

In this instance we use it in the following manner
	`cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443'`

`-s` skips the default probes (`http:80` and `https:443`)
`-p` adds additional probe (`protocol:port`)
