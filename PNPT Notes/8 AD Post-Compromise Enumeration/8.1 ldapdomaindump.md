Create a directory for the files that will be dumped via this tool
`mkdir mydirectory`
`cd mydirectory`

`sudo ldapdomaindump ldaps://10.0.0.200 -u 'DOMAIN\username' -p Password`

`ldaps://target` is the target machine
`-u` domain and username
`-p` password
`-o` can be used to output the files to a different directory

You get a good amount of information from the domain you are pulling from in different formats (html, grep, json).  Even if not admin, you can still get a good amount of info.  Just more if you have admin account.
