### Sudo

#### Sudo Shell Escaping

You can use some items that you find within `sudo -l` in order to spawn a shell with root or a reverse shell with root, among other things.

GTFOBins - https://gtfobins.github.io/    - An excellent resource for finding what those commands are and how to exploit them.

Linux PrivEsc Playground - https://tryhackme.com/room/privescplayground   - This is a tryhackme room with a machine with lots of Sudo and SUID vulns.


#### Intended Functionality

Sometimes there may not be something in GTFObins, but you can still google search and see if there are any exploits for privilege escaltion.

i.e., searching for "sudo apache2 privilege escaltion" in Google.

There may still be ways to escalate.

#### LD_PRELOAD

Also known as Preloading.  An example of this is in the THM room "Linux PrivEsc Arena"

You see it's exploitable by the `sudo -l` output of this....

```
TCM@debian:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for TCM on this host:
    env_reset, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD
```

Looking for this part specifically

`env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD`
