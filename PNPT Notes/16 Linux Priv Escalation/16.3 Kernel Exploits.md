Kernel Exploits - https://github.com/lucyoa/kernel-exploits

Use this page to check for kernel exploits against the kernel information you grabbed from `uname -a`

You can also run the linux exploit suggestor from the Automated tools section

`./linux-exploit-suggester`      - you'll need to get this onto the victim device and make it executable.

If you get things that need to be compiled, such as exploits in .c, you can use the following command to compile it so you can run it.

`gcc -pthread cOw.c -o cow`

This is for a well known vulnerability called Dirty Cow.  For this one, you'll actually get the script to run, it will look like it didn't work but if you type in `passwd`, you get this....

```
TCM@debian:~/tools/dirtycow$ ./cow

Now I have root.

If something feels like it may not be working, check documentation on that tool.  There may be more steps.
