### SUID

Set User ID - deals with permission settings.

```
TCM@debian:~$ ls -al
total 48
drwxr-xr-x  5 TCM  user 4096 Jun 18  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 May 15  2017 ..
-rw-------  1 TCM  user  801 Jun 18  2020 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 TCM  user  220 May 12  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 TCM  user 3235 May 14  2017 .bashrc
drwx------  2 TCM  user 4096 Jun 18  2020 .gnupg
```

First char - d is directory and '-' is a file  
SUID (rwx------) is the file owners permissions  
SGID (---rwx---) is the groups permissions  
End 3 (------rwx) is the permissions for everyone else  

`chmod +x <file>`   - will make the `<file>` executable  
`chmod 777 <file>`  - will give rwx to everyone for `<file>`  

The SUID comes in when you are able to run a file with the permissions of another user.  If that is set your Beg 3 would have `rws`.

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2> /dev/null`   - find starting from `/` root, looking for `-perm` permissions, belonging to the root user that has an "s" `-u=s`.  The type of item we're looking for is a file `-type f` and then spit it out on the screen.

Run that command and it should return a list that you can cross reference in GTFObins to see if there is an exploit.

The exploit in the machine that was the example had to be done line by line and some changes were made to the script.  It's in the VulnUniversity write up on github.
