This is the output you would see for this exploit.

To find this manually, you can run `dpkg -l | grep nginx`

```
sh-4.1$ dpkg -l | grep nginx
ii  nginx-common                        1.6.2-5+deb8u2~bpo70+1       small, powerful, scalable web/proxy server - common files
ii  nginx-full                          1.6.2-5+deb8u2~bpo70+1       nginx web/proxy server (standard version)
sh-4.1$ 
```

Any instance 1.6.2 or older could be vulnerable.

`find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2> /dev/null`  - This same `find` command.

You have to have the SUID bit (-rws------) set to S for /usr/bin/sudo

If you have both of those findings in the same device then you can likely exploit this vulnerability

At this point, there is a script provided in the link above that will do this exploit automatically.
