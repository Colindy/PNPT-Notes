This takes advantage of the stars * that show up when typing in a password.  If you try to do something as sudo, get asked for a password, and see the asterisks start to pop up, then you might try this exploit.

`sudo -V`  - This will tell you what version of sudo you are on.  For this exploit you must be on sudo version 1.8.26 or older.

`git clone https://github.com/saleemrashid/sudo-cve-2019-18634`

exploit.c will be compiled into a file to run the exploit.

I would clone the git, compile the program and then use wget to download it to the victim machine by hosting an http server on my device where the compiled exploit is.

`gcc -o <output-file> <source-file>`
