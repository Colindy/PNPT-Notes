### Researching Potential Vulnerabilities

This is where all your note taking will come in handy.  Here you take the versions of services you found and search for any vulnerabilities.

Search locations  
&ensp;	google.com  
&ensp;	exploit-db.com  
&ensp;	github.com  
&ensp;	rapid7.com ** This is the same company that makes metasploit, they may sometimes offer metasploit path to run the vuln.  

From Terminal  
&ensp;	`searchsploit Samba 2.2.1a` may not get you much  
&ensp;	`searchsploit Samba 2` may get you many more results so do not be too specific in your search.  
&ensp;&ensp;		This will search Metasploit to see if there are any built in vulns
