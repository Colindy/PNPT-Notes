### Scanning with Nessus

Installing  
&ensp;	Go to google and search nessus download, should be one of the top options  
&ensp;	Download x64 Ubuntu/Linux  
&ensp;	Go to the folder it downloaded in a terminal  
&ensp;	`dpkg -i Nessus[tab]` and that should install  
Start the scanner:  
&ensp;	You should get a command to type after the install finishes along with further directions  
&ensp;	`/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service` to start the nessus service  

Can get tools to make Nessus report an excel sheet file.  Nessus may also give some remediation steps.

Make sure to look stuff up and don't just trust the scanner.  If a vuln is reported, go find it.

Nessus may also be the other program that would be worth getting a license for.  Free version only allows internal network scanning along with limited tools.  

NOTE: If you are running and/or installing this on a VM, it is VERY CPU intensive.  Shut down everything but essential stuff and start it and go make a sammich.  I got to the point of loading it in the web-browser and it having to compile a number of plugins which took about 15-20 minutes for me.  For that duration I had to shutdown near everything else. :(
