### DNS Enumeration

Domain Name System (DNS)

#### DNS record types:

NS - Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.  
A - Contains the IPv4 address of a given domain name.  Also called "host record" or "a record".  
AAAA - Same as A record but is the IPv6 version.  
MX - Mail Exchange record contains the name of the servers reponsible for handling email for the domain.  There can be multiples of this for a single domain.  
PTR - Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and can find records associated with an IP address.  
CNAME - Canonical Name records are used to create aliases for other host records (A or AAAA).  
TXT - These text records contain other arbitrary data and can be used for various purposes such as verifing domain ownership.
