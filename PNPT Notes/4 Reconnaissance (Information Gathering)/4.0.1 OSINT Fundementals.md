##### Sock Puppets
Fake online representation.  The idea is to not draw attention to yourself.
	Make sure this is in no way able to be tied back to you.  Not on your devices, not with your accounts, not with your name, etc.  NO CONNECTION back to you.
		Creating Sock Puppets
			Lot of tutorials out there.  Main point is you want to not let this account connect back to you.  There are a number of resources out there to help with this.

##### Search Engine Operators
Google
	site:reddit.com
		This will return only items from reddit.com and no other sites.
	AND
		will show only sites with both portions of the search (`wgu AND calc1`).
	OR
		will all sites with either of the two search terms (`wgu OR calc1`).
	"wgu calc"
		This requires an exact match of what's inside the quotes.
	*
		can be used to fill in any missing term if you can't remember exact details.
	filetype:pdf
		this will return results that are pdf files.
	site:tesla.com -www
		This will show all sites with tesla.com that do NOT include www.  This is stackable
	intext:password    inurl:password    intitle:password
		This will show sites that have the word "password" in the body of the page.  You can also use `intitle:<word>` to get pages that have the word in the title.  `inurl:<word>` does the same for a word in the url itself.

DuckDuckGo
	Generally same operators as google.  Returns some more random results.  Biggest draw is it does not track searches.
Bing
	Microsoft's (poor) attempt at being google.
Yandex
	Russian-based search engine
Baidu
	Asian-based search engine (not very good for US or EU)

##### Reverse Image Searching
images.google.com
	drag and drop mostly.  Works well with buildings, not as well with faces.
yandex.com (russian based)
	will return more similar images for faces and not just the exact match of the photo used.
tineye.com
	not the greatest but it is another tool to use.
pimeyes.com
	not free, it's a paid service (around $30/month).  May also find similar items but will link to websites the image is found on.  Is a paid service though.

For all sites, the buildings are more easily searched as opposed to faces.  Faces will generally need to be with the same background, clothes, etc.  Buildings are easily located though.

##### Viewing EXIF Data

EXIF data is data that is stored in photographs.  Geotagging on phones can put coordinates.  There can also be information about the device used to take the photo.  Social Media will strip this most times but there may be some residual info left.  If a photo is sent from a device via text message or messanger apps, it's likely the info is still there.

##### Physical Location

Physical PenTest (legal breaking and entering).  Google maps satellite view.  Looking for things like employee entrance.  What's around the building.  Cameras, other doors, etc.  Any information you can get can end up being helpful.

##### Identifying Geographical Locations

Game called geoguessr.com can help sharpen skillz.  Also blog post about looking at pictures and what to look for.  `https://somerandomstuff1.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/geoguessr-the-top-tips-tricks-and-techniques/`

##### Email OSINT

hunter.io
	good site to look up email addresses.  I can not only give you emails, but also identifies the email pattern.  May have to sign in with a google account in order to get unfiltered info.  Only so many free searches.
phonebook.cz
	can also search domains and urls.  May spit out more than hunter.io.
voilanorbert.com
	Pretty close to hunter.io.  Only so many free searches.
clearbit
	Chrome only as extension.  Only so many free searches but works pretty well.  It will also tell you where it got the email from.  You can filter results by a dropdown.
tools.verifyemailaddress.io
	EmailHippo can verify email addresses for you.
`email-checker.net/validate`
	Same as EmailHippo.

##### Password OSINT

Hunting breached credentials.
dehashed.com
	paid service (only payable through cryptocurrentcy).  Many times you can cross reference info found here to find other accounts or location data or any number of things.
leakcheck.io
snusbase.com
haveibeenpwned.com
scylla.sh

##### Hunting Usernames and Accounts

namechk.com
	This is to search for available usernames and/or websites.
whatsmyname.app
	Another username lookup tool.
namecheckup.com
	Same as the other two.  Each has it's own ups and downs.  Work with all of them to get a better picture.
kik.me
	If you add a `/<username>`, you can see if there is a username on this site.  This can also work with snapchat and other social media sites.
