##### Social Media OSINT
Geocodes
	Obtained by searching in google for any location.  When the map comes up, this will be in the url of the results.

Twitter
	twitter.com/search-advanced is a great tool to search twitter.  Everything in twitter (unless the profile is private) will be public.
		Can also use `from:` `to:` and `@` to specify searches.
		You can also craft searches, almost like google dorks.
			`from:<person> since:<yyyy-mm-dd> until:<yyyy-mm-dd>` Will give you a result of tweets from a person between the dates in the range.  You can work with different operators too (from, to, @, etc).
			`from:<person> nfl` will show you any tweets from `<person>` talking about 'nfl'.
		You can also search geocodes (doesn't always work as geotags need to be turned on on the device that was used to make the post or take the picture)
			`geocode:<geocode.10km>`
				This will search within 10km of the geocode provided

Facebook
	Simple search can help but facebook has become more aware of privacy.
	Some tools to use:
		OSINT Tool Collection: https://github.com/rmdir-rp/OSINT-twitter-tools
		IntelligenceX Facebook Search - https://intelx.io/tools?tab=facebook
			Wildcard searches do not really work
				You can go to a user's page on facebook, view the page source, ctrl+f and enter userID and that will show you the user's ID.

Instagram
	Not the best searching.  Limited to pictures but a lot of info can be gleaned from pictures.
	On a profile, you can view page source and find profilePage_ and this will take you to the profile ID.  Even if you change your name, the ID will not change.
	`imginn.com/profile` where profile is the profile name.  But this will pull down the image.

SnapChat
	Not a whole lot of things for snapchat.  It doesn't really keep pictures after they are opened.
	`https://map.snapchat.com` can possibly give some information if you know a location.

Reddit
	/u/(name) to search users on reddit.
	you can also search google with operators with `site:reddit.com` and search there.

LinkedIn
	Business professionals facebook.  A lot of people share a lot of stuff on here.

TikTok
	/@username will search the user from the website.
	TikTok has locked down quite a bit since it's beginning days.
	Right click on a picture, open in a new tab, and now you have the full sized image.
