dehashed.com - This is a paid service.  Crypto only.  Could be worth a look.
	Appears to be able to really dig into a target.  Links to other accounts.  Passwords (and if unique enough, use that password to tie to other accounts).

Hashes.org - Might be able to checked any found hashes.

Finding information is key.  Maybe not through dehashed or a site like that but anywhere.  What happens if dehashed goes down?
