`*.website.com`

Finding subdomains can yield a lot of results.  Different things from hidden login pages to potentially sites that should not be public facing like test sites.

`sublist3r` - Not installed by default.  Will grab subdomains.

Website crt.sh uses certificate fingerprinting.  This can also give a good number of leads.  May grab what sublist3r may not.

owasp amass project - install via github (pre-installed on kali).  feels kinda slow but definitely worth checking out further.  https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md for the tutorial.

tomnomnom httprobe - Will take a list from tools (like sublist3r) and check to see if those sites are live or not.
