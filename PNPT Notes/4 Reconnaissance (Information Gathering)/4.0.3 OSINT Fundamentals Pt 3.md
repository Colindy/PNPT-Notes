	`phoneinfoga serve -p 8080` - Run this and then go to `http://localhost:8080` and this will give you a local webpage to run your searches from.

Social Media OSINT

##### OSINT Frameworks

`recon-ng` - works a lot like metasploit
	Has a place called the `marketplace`.
		`marketplace search` - Will list out the tools available.
		`marketplace install <tool>` - will install the tool you specify
		`modules load <tool>` - will load the tool you wish to use
		`show hosts` - will show you the host table that has been built thus far.  This will hold between tools

Maltego - Open from icon.  Run Maltego Free.  This will require an account.
	This is a program that uses 'modules'.  Some tools require API keys for most if not all of these modules.

Hunchly - https://hunch.ly
	Web capture tool designed for investigations.  This is also a paid tool.  It is a google chrome extension, will only run in Chrome.

##### OSINT Automation

Many of these things can be automated with some scripting language.  They are all pretty much command line based.  Just make sure you follow good practices.
	Create directories and sub-directories in your scripts to keep your files organized.
	Test your code to make sure it processes like you want
	Refine and filter your scripts based on what you want to actually test
		Make sure you are limiting your scans to in-scope items so you don't get unwanted extra info
