### Mimikatz

Used to view and steal creds, generate Kerberos tickets, and leverage attacks.  This will almost always be picked up by AV now so it would need to be obfuscated.  
Can also dump Credentials store in memory  
Has a number of different attacks: cred dumping, pass the hash, over pass the hash, pass the ticket, silver ticket, and golden ticket, etc

First thing, set privilege mode to debug  
&ensp;`mimikatz.exe` in whatever folder it was extracted in  
&ensp;`privilege::`    - This will show what modules are available  
&ensp;`privilege::debug` (should spit out privilege '20' OK  

`sekurlsa::` will show us what sekurlsa modules are available

`sekurlsa::logonPasswords` will spit out a bunch of password information in their different hash.  This could have cleartext passwords
