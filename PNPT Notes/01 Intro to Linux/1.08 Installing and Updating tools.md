### Installing and Updating  

To update and upgrade OS and tools  
&ensp;	`sudo apt update && apt upgrade`     This may need to be run as root (`sudo su -`)  
&ensp;&ensp;		This may not always be wise as updates can be known to break tools.  

To install a single package  
&ensp;	`sudo apt install apache2` where `apache2` is the name of the package you want to install  

The `git` command - on github, check Stars, forks, last update to see if the tool is worth it  
&ensp;&ensp;		It's worth noting that tools installed can be installed in the `/opt` folder  
&ensp;	`rm -rf pimpmykali/`          # Run this only if you have ran this before to remove the old instance  
&ensp;	`sudo git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali`  
&ensp;	`cd pimpmykali`  
&ensp;	`sudo ./pimpmykali.sh`  
&ensp;	For a new kali vm, run menu option `N` (run this the first time using pimpmykali in a particular VM)
