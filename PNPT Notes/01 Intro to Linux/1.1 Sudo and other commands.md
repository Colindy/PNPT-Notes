explainshell.com         A good shell resource for seeing what shell commands do and breaking down the options that are used with them.

`sudo`
	"Super User Do" - user must be part of sudoers file in order to use this. 
	`sudo su -`     this command will switch user to root ("exit" will bring you back to your user state)

Piping, or `|` is running one command and then the next and then the next for however many `|` you have.
	ex: `cat ip.txt | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":"` 
		This is going to read the file ip.txt and then `grep` is going to grab every line with "64 bytes" in it.  Then we use cut to go to the 4th field (`-d` saying the delimiter will be the " " and it will count 4 fields in, `-f 4`) and grab whatever was right in front of it.  Once that is done, the final part, `tr -d ":"`, will use translate and remove the :.

You can do 'one liners' to chain commands together.
	ex: `for ip in $(cat ip.txt); do nmap $ip; done`
		This will take each line in the file 'ip.txt' and run nmap on it.

If you have a process that you are opening in the command line, you can end the command with `&` and it will release the command prompt to you and keep the program running.
	ex: `mousepad first.py&`     This will keep mousepad from hogging the cmd prompt ;)

If running a kali instance in a VM, you can use the following command to mount shared drives from the host operating system
	```
	mkdir share
	sudo mount -t vboxsf <drive name> ./share```
