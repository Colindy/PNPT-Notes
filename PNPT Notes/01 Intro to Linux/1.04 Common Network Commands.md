### Common networking commands  

`ip a`    will show all network interface configurations for all adapters, both wired and wireless  
`ipconfig`   just like `ip a`, it will show all but only the wired adapters  
`iwconfig`   is the same as `ifconfig` but for wireless adapters  

`ip n`    the 'n' stands for neighbor.  same as `arp -a`  

`ip r`   the 'r' stands for route.  will show you the current routing table  
&ensp;	`route`   will do the same thing  

`ping`    is the wonderful ping command.
