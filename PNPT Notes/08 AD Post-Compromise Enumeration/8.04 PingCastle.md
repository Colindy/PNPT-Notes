### PingCastle Tool

www.pingcastle.com - This can be a paid sub item, free to use for personal use but much have a license for consulting use.  Running it on your own stuff (be it personal or business for you sysadmins out there) is free to do so.  

This can be run on Windows.  Will download a .zip file, run this tool as admin.  This can be run remotely via command prompt.  

Takes a couple minutes to run.  Will spit out an html file that will give you more information.  Can even suggest some remediation tactics.
