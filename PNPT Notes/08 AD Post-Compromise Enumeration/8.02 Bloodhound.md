### Bloodhound Tool

In order to make sure you have the most features, grab the latest install if you haven't in a while

`sudo pip install bloodhound`

This will start the neo4j console which is required to run bloodhound  
`sudo neo4j console`

This will give you a server address somewhere in the output  
`Remote interface available at http://localhost:7474` or another random port number

First time will make you change the password but default is  
neo4j:neo4j (default creds) **DO NOT FORGET**  (These will be the same for plumhound)  
&ensp;	First set on my vm on 5/20 neo4j1  

Now we run bloodhound  
`sudo bloodhound`  - This will open a browser, asking for the creds that were just created  

Back to the command line  
`sudo bloodhound-python -d PNPT.local -u fcastle -p Password1 -ns 10.0.0.200 -c all`  
-d Domain  
-u User  
-p Password  
-ns name server or AD server  
-c collecting (here we're collecting all)  

Once you collect all your info from the previous command, you can import that into bloodhound website.  You will get a prog bar for your files uploading.  Left hand top corner will have some items to dig through :)
