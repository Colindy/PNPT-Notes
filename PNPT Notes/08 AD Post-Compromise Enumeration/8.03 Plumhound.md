### Plumbhound Tool

This is the sister tool of Bloodhound.  Described as "Bloodhound for Blue and Purple teams".

Get it from github (google search)

`cd /opt`  
`sudo git clone https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound.git`  
`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`   This should install things  

Now run it   (need neo4j running as well as bloodhound for this to run)  
`sudo python3 PlumHound.py --easy -p password`  
&ensp;This will verify connection  

`sudo python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks -p password`  
&ensp;This will run PlumHound.  There are a number of different tasks and such that can be run.  Very good documentation on this tool's github.  

Goes into `/reports` in the directory you're in and gives you a number of pages with different info.

Gives a number of different info items beyond what Bloodhound gives you so look at these as well.
