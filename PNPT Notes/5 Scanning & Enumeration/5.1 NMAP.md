`nmap -T4 -p- -A`
	This command has a few options set
		-T4 is the speed.  scale of 1 to 5, 1 being slow, 5 being super fast.  Fast is more likely to get picked up and miss things.  1 is less likely to miss things but will take a while to run through.
		-p- is set to scan all ports.  can set -p (port number) to scan specific ports or you can leave it off altogether.  If left off, nmap will scan the top 1000 ports (most common).
		-A Give me all info that you can give me.

Some things to think about:
	-sU or UDP scan can take a long time.  You may not want to always use this one.
	-A may also take a bit longer to run.  Try using this on specific ports after you've identified ports that are open and responding.

You'll notice that some ports are more eye-catching than others.  80, 443, 139 & 445 (Samba, SMB) could start to stand out.

Also, you want to take notes on any info gathered.  Screenshots, the whole bit.  This will help you later.  Scanning and Enumeration are likely the most important step in a pentest so make sure you are through.  Leave no bit unturned!!
