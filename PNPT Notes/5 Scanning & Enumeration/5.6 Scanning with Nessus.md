	Download x64 Ubuntu/Linux

	`dpkg -i Nessus[tab]` and that should install
Start the scanner:
	You should get a command to type after the install finishes along with further directions

Can get tools to make Nessus report an excel sheet file.  Nessus may also give some remediation steps.

Make sure to look stuff up and don't just trust the scanner.  If a vuln is reported, go find it.

Nessus may also be the other program that would be worth getting a license for.  Free version only allows internal network scanning along with limited tools.
