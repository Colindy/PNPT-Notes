This is where all your note taking will come in handy.  Here you take the versions of services you found and search for any vulnerabilities.

Search locations
	google.com
	exploit-db.com
	github.com
	rapid7.com ** This is the same company that makes metasploit, they may sometimes offer metasploit path to run the vuln.

From Terminal
	`searchsploit Samba 2.2.1a` may not get you much
	`searchsploit Samba 2` may get you many more results so do not be too specific in your search.
		This will search Metasploit to see if there are any built in vulns
