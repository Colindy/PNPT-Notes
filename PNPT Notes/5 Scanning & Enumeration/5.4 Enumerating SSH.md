For SSH enumeration, it's pretty straightforward.  Use a method to gather the version if you can and see if it will accept a sign in.  Trying a sign in moves to exploitation so going to save that for later.

There may be times where you get a 'no matching key' error.  Use the following command
	`ssh 10.0.2.8 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`
		In this, you can copy and paste what was offered in the error but this may still get another error about 'no matching cipher'.
	`ssh 10.0.2.8 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes128-cbc`
		The `-c aes128-cbc` is the first one that was offered in the matching cipher error.  This should now allow you to get the connection prompt.

This is done in case there is a banner present that may provide some insight into what version is being run, who built it, etc.
