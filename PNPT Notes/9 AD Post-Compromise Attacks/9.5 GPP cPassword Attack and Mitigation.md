This is an older attack but still relevant

GPP (Group Policy Preferences) allowed admins to create policies using embedded credentials.  These embedded credentials were encrypted and stored in a "cPassword".  The key was accidently released allowing for decryption of those embedded credentials.  This was patched in MS14-025 but doesn't prevent previous uses.  If this was in use before the patch, those embedded credentials may still be useful.

`gpp-decrypt <cpassword>`

With Metasploit, requires credentials (smb_enum_gpp) be valid, doens't matter what type of credentials.  

Mitigation Strategies
	Patch as this is fixed in KB2962486
	Delete the old GPP xml files stored in the SYSVOL
