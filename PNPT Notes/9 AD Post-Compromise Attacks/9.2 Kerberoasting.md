Takes advantage of service accounts.

If we have any domain account, we can request a TGT or Ticket Granting Ticket from the KDC (Key Distribution Center), in this case, our DC.
The DC will then grant us that and it will be encrypted with the krbtgt hash
We then request a TGS or Service Ticket for the Server.  We present our TGT
We then Recieve our TGS encrypted with the Server's account Hash
	This is the step we are interested in
We would then present the TGS for service encrypted with the servers account to the application server
We would then be authenticated or not depending on the authorization we are granted

`python GetUserSPNs.py PNPT.local/fcastle:Password1 -dc-ip 10.0.0.200 -request`
	This will give some info besides just the hash.  You want to pay attention to other things too like LastLogon field.  If it's set to never or a long time ago, it could be a honeypot account.
	The hash is the whole thing, from `$` till the end of the string

The hash will be spit out and we can take that and run it through hashcat after dumping it into a txt file
	`hashcat -m 13100 kerberoast.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
		-m 13100 is the module for kerberos hashes
