The `socket` module in python is used to connect to network nodes.  
A simple script for this is:

```
#!/bin/python3

import socket

HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 7777

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) #af_inet is ipv4, sock_stream is a port

s.connect((HOST,PORT)) #Having these double (()) makes this a tuple
```
This will connect to a device with the host address of 127.0.0.1 on port 7777.

Now we can take that and use it to construct a workable port scanner

```
#!/bin/python3

import sys
import socket
from datetime import datetime as dt

#Define the target
if len(sys.argv) == 2: #This checks the number of arguments entered, needs to be 2
	target = socket.gethostbyname(sys.argv[1]) #Translate hostname to ipv4
else:
	print("Invalid amoust of arguments.")
	print("Syntax: python3 scanner.py <ip>") #This kicks back if there are not 2 arguments

#Add a pretty banner
print("-" * 50)
print(f"Scanning target {target}")
print(f"Time started: {str(dt.now())}")
print("-" * 50)

try:
	for port in range(50,85):
		s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
		socket.setdefaulttimeout(1) #This sets the timeout to 1 second
		result = s.connect_ex((target,port)) #connect_ex() checks for a connection error.  0 means port is open.  1 means port is closed.
		if result == 0:
			print(f"Port {port} is open.")
		s.close()

except KeyboardInterrupt: #This will handle the keyboard ctrl+c
	print("\nExiting program.")
	sys.exit()

except socket.gaierror: #This is the error when the hostname can not be resolved
	print("Hostname could not be resolved.")
	sys.exit()

except socket.error: #This is what happens when there is no connection available
	print("Could not connect to server.")
	sys.exit()

```

You might still make this a bit more robust.  You could ensure that the ip is a legitimate IP, not just 845.234.534.234 or something of that sort.  
You also have some error checking with a `try` and `except`.
