### Importing Modules

You can import different modules for functionality.

```
import sys #This will import all the functions from the module 'sys'
from datetime import datetime as dt #This will import the datetime function from the datetime module and allow you to use it as 'dt'

print(sys.version) #This will give you the system version
print(dt.now()) #This will give you the current date and time
```
