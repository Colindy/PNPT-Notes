### Classes and Objects

All classes have an `__init__` function.  This is used to assign attributes to a class.  It's good practice to capitalize the names of classes in your code.  Also, you will find it helpful to put your classes in their own file and then import them into your program.

```
class Employees:

	def __init__(self, name, department, role, salary, years_employed):
		self.name = name
		self.department = department
		self.role = role
		self.salary = salary
		self.years_employed = years_employed
		
	def eligible_for_retirement(self):
		if self.years_employed >= 20:
			return True
		else:
			return False
```
Above, you see the class.  Notice the name is capitalized.  Also, think of the `self` as it's own placeholder.  I'll explain better in the next bit...

```
#!/bin/python3

from Employees import Employees

e1 = Employees("Bob", "Sales", "Director", 100000, 20)
e2 = Employees("Linda", "Executive", "CIO", 150000, 10)

print(e1.name)
print(e2.role)
print(e1.eligible_for_retirement())
print(e2.eligible_for_retirement())
```

The `self` will hold either `e1` or `e2` in it.  They both have the same attributes but those attributes are specific to each employee.  `e1`'s name is Bob while `e2`'s name is Linda.
