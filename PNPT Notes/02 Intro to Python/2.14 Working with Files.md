### Working with Files

Working with files can be tricky so here's some things of note  
Know what mode your in  
&ensp;	r - is for read mode
&ensp;	w - is for write mode
&ensp;	a - is for append mode

Appending will add the input from the `.write()` method immediately after what is in the file.  You'll need to use \n for new lines and such

`file.seek(0)` will take you back to the beginning of the file.  Otherwise you will not be able to read through the file twice.

```
file = open('months.txt')

print(file) #This will actually print some info about the file, not the file contents itself.
print(file.mode) #This will show the file's mode
print(file.readable()) #This will return a True of False if the file is readable
file.seek(0) #This will return to the beginning of the file
print(file.read()) #This will actually read the contents of the file.
file.seek(0)
print("\n")
print(file.readline()) #This will read a single line from the file
print(file.readline()) #This will read the second line from the file
file.seek(0)
print("\n")
print(file.readlines()) #This will print a list of all the lines in the file.
file.seek(0)
print("\n")
#You can also read through lines in a loop
for month in file:
	print(month.strip()) #The .strip() function will remove extra spaces in the output

file.close()

print("\n")

days = open("days.txt", "a") #The "w" opens the file in write mode.  The "a" allows for appending

print(days.mode) #This will verify that we're in write mode

days.write("Monday") #The 'write' command will overwrite anything previously in the file
days.write("\nTeusday") #Since we changed the mode to 'a', this will now append.

days.close()

```
