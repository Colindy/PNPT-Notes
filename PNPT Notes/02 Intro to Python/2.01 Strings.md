###  Some Simple Python

`print ("Hello world!")`  

Hello world is the string in this line of code  
```
`print("Hello world!")
`print('Hello world!')
`print("""This string runs
`multiple lines!""") # triple quotes for multi-line
`print("This string is "+"awesome!") # concatenation
`print('\n') # new line
`print('Test that new line')`
```

### Advanced Strings ^.^  

```
my_name = "Chris"
print(my_name[0]) #This will print the first letter of 'my_name'
print(my_name[-1]) #This will print the last letter of the 'my_name'

sentence = "This is a sentance."
print(sentence[:4]) #This will print the first 4 characters of the string
print(sentence.split()) #delimeter - default if left blank is a space

sentence_split = sentence.split() #This set a list of each word as a variable
sentence_join = ' '.join(sentence_split) #This will rejoin the sentence together using a space as the delimiter
print(sentence_join)

quote = "He said, 'Give me all your money!'" #You can make strings with both ' and "
print(quote)
quote = "He said, \"Give me all your money!\"" #The \ is an escape char, telling python to ignore it
print(quote)

too_much_space = "                      hello                "
print(too_much_space)
print(too_much_space.strip()) #This will strip out all the spaces at the front and back of the string.

print("A" in "Apple") #This will print a boolean value if A is, in fact, in Apple. Case sensitive!!
print("a" in "Apple") #This will print False since a does not equal A

letter = "A"
word = "Apple"
print(letter.lower() in word.lower()) #This is a more robust way to avoid mistakes because of case.

movie = "The Nightmare Before Christmas"
print(f"My favorite movie is {movie}.") #This is called String Literal method.  It's the current way to format strings
