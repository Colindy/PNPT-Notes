Lists are changeable.
They are enclosed in `[ ]`

```
movies = ["Nightmare Before Christmas", "The Boondock Saints", "Star Wars", "Deadpool"]

print(movies[0]) #This will print the first item of the list.
print(movies[1]) #This will print the second item of the list.
print(movies[1:3]) #This will from the second item up to but NOT including the last number
print(movies[1:]) #This will print everyting from the second item to the end of the list
print(movies[:3]) #This will print everything from the beginning to the fourth item
print(movies[-1]) #This will grab the last item in the list

print(len(movies)) #Count the items in the list
movies.append("Pulp Fiction")  # This adds an item to the end of the list
print(movies)

movies.insert(2, "End Game") #This will insert the string into the third spot in the list.
print(movies)

movies.pop() #Removes the last item from the list
print(movies)

movies.pop(0) #Removes the first item in the list
print(movies)

cindy_movies = ["Strange Magic", "Maleficent"]

our_favs = movies + cindy_movies #This will combine two or more lists
print(our_favs)

grades = [["Bob", 82], ["Alice", 90], ["Pat", 98], ["Jain", 45]]
bobs_grade = grades[0][1]  #This will go to the first list and pull the second item from within that list.
print(f"Bob got a {bobs_grade}")
grades[0][1] = 85
print(f"No he didn't, he got a {grades[0][1]}")
