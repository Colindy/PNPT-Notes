##### Conditional Statements

Conditional Statements check the condition of a statement and then take action depending on whether the statement is True or False.

```
def drink(money):
	if money >= 2:
		return "You've got yourself a drink."
	else:
		return "No drink for you!"

print(drink(3))
print(drink(1))

def alcohol(age, money):
	if (age >= 21) and (money >= 5):
		return "We're having fun tonight!"
	elif (age >= 21) and (money < 5):
		return "Come back with more money!"
	elif (age < 21) and (money >= 5):
		return "You're not old enough!! GOWAI!"
	else:
		return "You're too young and too poor"


print(alcohol(34, 10))
print(alcohol(25, 3))
